The film begins in 1919, with Greek immigrants from Odessa arriving near Thessaloniki. Led by the charismatic Spyros, they establish a new settlement in the delta of a river. The youngest of the settlers are Spyros' son Alexis and an orphan from Odessa, Eleni. A strong, almost incestuous affection develops between the teenagers, resulting in twins who are given to a foster family. Also standing in the way of love is Spyros, determined to take his foster daughter as his wife. The lovers then decide to flee the village, persecuted by their father, leading a life of exile. As Alexis joins a group of musicians planning to go to the United States, Eleni regains custody of the twins. Angelopoulos, as in previous films, looks at the sacrifice of civilians confronted by the workers' demonstrations of 1935, the rule of Metaxas' fascist junta and forced emigration to America, and finally the civil war of 1944-1949.", "rating": "4.28 out of 5", "Cast List": [{"castRealName": "Alexandra Aidini", "castActorpage": "/actor/alexandra-aidini/", "character": "Eleni"}, {"castRealName": "Nikos Poursanidis", "castActorpage": "/actor/nikos-poursanidis/", "character": "Alexis"}, {"castRealName": "Giorgos Armenis", "castActorpage": "/actor/giorgos-armenis/", "character": "Nikos"}, {"castRealName": "Vasilis Kolovos", "castActorpage": "/actor/vasilis-kolovos/", "character": "Spyros"}, {"castRealName": "Eva Kotamanidou", "castActorpage": "/actor/eva-kotamanidou/", "character": "Kassandra"}, {"castRealName": "Toula Stathopoulou", "castActorpage": "/actor/toula-stathopoulou/", "character": "Woman in the Coffee House"}, {"castRealName": "Thalia Argyriou", "castActorpage": "/actor/thalia-argyriou/", "character": "Danai"}, {"castRealName": "Smaro Gaitanidou", "castActorpage": "/actor/smaro-gaitanidou/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Mihalis Giannatos", "castActorpage": "/actor/mihalis-giannatos/", "character": "Zisis"}, {"castRealName": "Grigoris Evangelatos", "castActorpage": "/actor/grigoris-evangelatos/", "character": "Teacher"}, {"castRealName": "Aliki Kamineli", "castActorpage": "/actor/aliki-kamineli/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Amdromachi Chrisomelli", "castActorpage": "/actor/amdromachi-chrisomelli/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Alex Moukanos", "castActorpage": "/actor/alex-moukanos/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Dimitris Kolovos", "castActorpage": "/actor/dimitris-kolovos/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Thodoros Teknetzidis", "castActorpage": "/actor/thodoros-teknetzidis/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Foulis Boudouroglou", "castActorpage": "/actor/foulis-boudouroglou/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Theofilos Alexopoulos", "castActorpage": "/actor/theofilos-alexopoulos/", "character": ""}, {"castRealName": "Than.

In a provincial town, which is surrounded with nothing else but frost. It is bitterly cold weather — without snow. Even in this bewildered cold hundreds of people are standing around the circus tent, which is put up in the main square, to see — as the outcome of their wait — the chief attraction, the stuffed carcass of a real whale. The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighboring settlings, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs — the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost — disturbs the order of the small town. Ambitious personages of the story feel they can take advantage of this situation. The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness.
